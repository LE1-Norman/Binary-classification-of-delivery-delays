# Binary-classification-of-delivery-delays
ML project for binary classification of delivery delays using Python and Scikit-learn

This project focuses on predicting delivery delays using machine learning. The goal is to build a binary classification model that can identify whether a delivery will be delayed based on various features.

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics/data

Size: 10999 lines, 12 features

Target: On_time (0 - is on time, 1 - delay)

This project covers all stages of the machine learning process, from data collection and preprocessing to model development using selected optimal parameters. The paper considers three methods: KNN (K-nearest neighbors), SVM (support vector machine), and random forest.

Results:

Модель Accuracy ROC-AUC

KNN     0.64      0.70

SVM     0.67      0.74

RF      0.69      0.75
